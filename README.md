## The Five Planes

### Users and Objectives

1. Academics
   - As a researcher, I would like to see the population trend of different age groups over the years collected so that I can study factors towards aging population in different periods
  
2. Policy Makers
   - As a policy maker, I would like to see the different sets of demographic data collected so that I can make better decisions towards new policy and/or policy changes

3. Business Owners / Foreign Investors
   - As a business owner, I would like to see the geographical distribution of the country I am interested in so that I would know if the market is suited for my product/service within a region/zone
  
4. General Public
   - As a citizen, I would like to see the proportion to see residency ratio due to concerns of rising population and crowding issues

### High Level Scope

The site should at least contain data visualization of the population structure by age group, gender, ethnicity and residency type to provide a general overview of the markup of Singapore over the years. It should also provide distribution of the population in different regions of Singapore.
